# A Paginated, Responsive Table using Angular

Just a quick and dirty demonstration of how a table could be built with angular.

Some things of note:
<ol>
<li>The data is loaded from a JSON file</li>
<li>The table uses hand written functions to do the filtering work</li>
<li>The whole app is written by creating normal javascript functions and then wireing the app together with angular functions.</li>
<li>Uses only hand written CSS originated by me</li>
</ol>
